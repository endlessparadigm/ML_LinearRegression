# ML_Model_Dataset
Creating a machine learning model and training the dataset.

In my ambition to learn more about AI and ML related concepts, I made a small write up related to obtaining a dataset, defining/training a model, and applying statistical methodology and ML fundamentals in hopes of learning more about the subject. See below.

[Abstract]
(Made-up business case) - We work at a mid-sized firm that provides frozen products at stores or grocery stores. One product in particular is a lunch plate containing avocadoes. Due to the high cost of avocadoes (indeed with respect to the cost of the other ingredients contained in the plate), the business has requested for a predictive analytics model to be applied to the ongoing cost of the ingredient to ensure product profitability. (Ex: Changing the tolerance of the mix of ingredients present while retaining the appropriate mix of ingredients as expected by the Brand based on present market need and sale value at the store). 

[Creating and Obtaining the Dataset]
For this we will need to obtain a dataset of the avocadoes purchased over time, along with the sale value.

[CSV]
The above CSV was obtained from Kaggle here. (..and as mentioned, is entirely unrelated to the made-up business case)

2. Gather the data/create  a dataset
3. Train the model (which will we use?)
